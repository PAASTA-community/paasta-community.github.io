### How robust is phylogenetic inference from limited protein sequence data?
This month's talk will be given by Johanna Krüger and will deal with the challenges of inferring phylogenetic relationships based on the limited and degraded protein sequence information that we are usually able to extract.
The talk can be rewatched on the PAASTA YouTube channel, [**YouTube recording**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZwZyOQOWc&ab_channel=PAASTAcommunity).
