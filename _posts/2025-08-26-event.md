### Pre-ISBA PAASTA Conference
On the day before the start of the 11th ISBA meeting we are organising a hybrid one-day pre-conference meeting focused on palaeoproteomics.
The pre-conference will consist of three sessions:
- Enamel-based sex determination
- Method development
- Applications
Additionally, we will take this opportunity to provide an overview of how PAASTA has grown during the last two years and present ongoing and upcoming PAASTA projects.
Last but not least, the elections for the next PAASTA steering committee will be opened during the conference.
