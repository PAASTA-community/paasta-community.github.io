### PAASTA Conference - New Methods & Approaches
This autumn we are organising the first PAASTA conference with the theme "New Methods & Approaches".
The conference will be a one-day online event and will be held on the 26th of September. 
In the morning there will be four invited talks on the current state of palaeoproteomics, as well as on what the future might bring. In the afternoon, there will be several sessions of 10 minute talks by early career researchers for which we would like to invite abstracts. Apart from the standard one-presenter presentations, we would also like to encourage TAG team presentations by researchers from different groups working on similar topics. You can sign up as a pre-formed team or allow to be matched to other presenters by the organisation.
