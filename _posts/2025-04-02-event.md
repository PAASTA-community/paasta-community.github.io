### A User Guide for species identification using ClassiCOL
For the second month on a row the monthly talk focuses on a new bioinformatic tool for palaeoproteomic analysis. This month, Alex Burnett gives a demonstration on how to use ClassiCOL, a new tool to facilitate taxonomic identifications using LC-MS/MS data. ClassiCOL was recently published in the [Journal of Proteome Research](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00962) and the tool is freely accessible on [Github](https://github.com/EngelsI/ClassiCOL).

A recording of this talk is available on [PAASTA's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA36dn_zKfs&ab_channel=PAASTAcommunity).
