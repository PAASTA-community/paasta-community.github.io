### PaleoProPhyler: a reproducible pipeline for phylogenetic inference using ancient proteins
During the monthly talk of March, Ioannis Patramanis presents his new tool for protein-based phylogenetic analysis and the associated opportunities and challenges. This research was published in the [Peer Community Journal](https://peercommunityjournal.org/item/10_24072_pcjournal_344/) and the tool is freely accessible on [Github](https://github.com/johnpatramanis/Proteomic_Pipeline/tree/main).
