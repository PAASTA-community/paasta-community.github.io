### Introduction to GitHub & how to make community-curated version tracked resources

For a change we had two monthly talks in December. The second of which was given by Alexander Hübner on how to start working with GitHub, particularly focusing on its potential for making and maintaining communit-curated version tracked srouces.
You can rewatch the talk on the PAASTA YouTube channel, [**YouTube recording**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Ck_8u69Ak&ab_channel=PAASTAcommunity).
