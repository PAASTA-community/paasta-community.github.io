### Integrating ZooMS and Zooarchaeology: Building Community and Exploring Neanderthal Subsistence
In this first monthly talk of 2025, Pauline Raymond discusses the developments in integrating ZooMS analyses in zooarchaeological research, especially with a focus on Neanderthal subsistence. 
This research also features in the [special issue of PaleoAnthropology](https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/1244) on ZooMS and zooarchaeology.
