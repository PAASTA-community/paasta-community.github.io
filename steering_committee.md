<!-- Place holder text for until we have a committee -->
Currently the PAASTA steering committee is still being formed.
The elected committee members will soon be announced after the first PAASTA meeting.

<!-- Hello all!

We, the Steering Committee of the PAASTA community would like to take a moment to introduce ourselves and give you all a quick idea of what we do.

First, what is the Steering Committee? This is a new organizing committee that was formed last year during the [**PAASTA4**](https://PAASTA-community.github.io/events/2022/10/12/event-PAASTA4/) conference. It is intended to guide the PAASTA community in a more formalized way; this involves brainstorming and proposing new initiatives and helping new initiatives get off the ground (like the successfully  launched [**PAASTAtisch**](https://PAASTA-community.github.io/projects/#PAASTAtisch)), increasing engagement and support for PAASTA members and events, helping with ongoing organization efforts, publicization of PAASTA, and sourcing funds for the maintenance of PAASTA.

We all are volunteers on the Steering Committee and we are really excited to work with all of you and help improve the PAASTA community.

## The Steering Committee Members

Miriam Bravo-Lopez (she/her) - Chair

I am a Mexican postdoctoral researcher at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research (LIIGH), UNAM. My passion lies in exploring the evolutionary journey of ancient human pathogens using paleogenomics and paleoproteomics. I find solace hanging out with dogs, and when it comes to activities, running is my top pick.
