 Hello all!

Although PAASTA is very much a bottom-up led community, there is still need for a small steering committee for the daily management. Here are short descriptions of who the people in the Steering Committee are and what they do.

To begin with what the Steering Committee, it is a small committee, whose main responsibility is to manage the practicalities of keeping a community running, such as finance and communication. 

## The Steering Committee Members

Jan Dekker - Vice-chair

I am currently pursuing a joint PhD degree at the University of York and the University of Copenhagen. My research focuses on the role of charred foodcrusts as a reservoir of dietary proteins in an attempt to learn more about dietary change between the Danish Mesolithic and Neolithic. Apart from all that, I like to go running and hiking.

Carli Peters - Secretary

I am a postdoc in the Department of Archaeology at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany. My research mostly focuses on the application of ZooMS in Australia, and I also am interested in ways to combine zooarchaeological and ZooMS datasets. Outside of work, I love to cook and play badminton!

I am a PhD Candidate and the lab manager for ADaPT Laboratory Facilities, a centre for ancient DNA and protein analysis led by Dr. Camilla Speller at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My PhD research is focused on the extraction of proteins from pottery residues, particularly in Mexico and Peru for understandings of past foodways and cuisine. As the lab manager for ADaPT, I also regularly apply ZooMS to a wide range of materials for taxonomic identification.

**Social media team**

The social media team is responsible for the outreach of the community, by tweeting, emailing as well as updating the website. Social media officers will announce new initiatives, conferences, papers and jobs that are relevant for the PAASTA community. They will also be responsible for maintaining the YouTube channel of the community.

**Engagement team**

The engagement officers are responsible for coming up with new initiatives (projects, summer schools, outreach activities, etc.) and propose them to the community. They will also oversee ongoing initiatives and provide support for them to reach their goals. They will ensure that the initiative is known in the community, as well as outside the community together with the media team. As well as suggesting potential funding sources for the initiative, by engaging with the treasurer team. 

**Support team**

In contrast to the other roles in the steering committee, the support team does not have a single defined task. Instead, its primary role is to support the other members of the steering committee where necessary in case of increased workload.
